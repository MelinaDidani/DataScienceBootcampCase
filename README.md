# DataScienceBootcampCase
My notes and exercises regarding Complete Data Science Training Bootcamp: Mathematics, Statistics, Python, Advanced Statistics in Python, Machine &amp; Deep Learning

1. Preprocessing -  We preprocess the data.
2. Machine learning - This section will incorporate the work we did in the preprocessing part into the code necessary for making the next step. We used a logistic regression model and other machine learning tools and techniques.
3. absenteeism_ - Python version of the whole work we've done, that could be passed to the other workers
4. Export data - General table for our data, result of the work done above
5. Used Tableau to analyse separate dependencies between the inputs of our model.

The course provided an entire toolbox needed to become a data scientist
- In demand data science skills: Statistical analysis, Python programming with NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn, Advanced statistical analysis, Tableau, Machine Learning with stats models and scikit-learn, Deep learning with TensorFlow
- How to pre-process data
- Understand the mathematics behind Machine Learning (an absolute must which other courses don’t teach!)
- Start coding in Python and learn how to use it for statistical analysis
- Perform linear and logistic regressions in Python
- Carry out cluster and factor analysis
- Be able to create Machine Learning algorithms in Python, using NumPy, statsmodels and scikit-learn
- Apply your skills to real-life business cases
- Use state-of-the-art Deep Learning frameworks such as Google’s TensorFlowDevelop a business intuition while coding and solving tasks with big data
- Unfold the power of deep neural networks
- Improve Machine Learning algorithms by studying underfitting, overfitting, training, validation, n-fold cross validation, testing, and how hyperparameters could improve performance
